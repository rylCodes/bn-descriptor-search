However, corrections are not permitted if you mistakenly selected the wrong scope. For instance, the client selected the 'City/Municipality' but you accidentally selected only the 'Barangay'. The process is for you to upgrade or downgrade accordingly. The client will pay for what they checked, and you will pay for the incorrect selection you made. So, be careful not to mistakenly select the national level",
